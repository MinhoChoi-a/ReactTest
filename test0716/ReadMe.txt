Dear

Hope all is well with you. I completed the task. Please check the zip file from the Google Drive Link. 

I seprated server for Frontend and Backend. You will need a maven, jdk, node and npm on your machine to load 2 applciations.

I tried my best to make this application. And I added some creativity. 
Please check the below. That is the list of additional features of this application.

1. error message when user added item more then the inventory
2. edit quanity of each item on cart
3. data loading / no search result message
4. responsive design (it is working on mobile as well)

I'd like to mention that this is not the maximum what I can make. If I have more time and resource, then I'm sure that I can make much better application. And I can promise you that I will do my best to make product for clients.

Thanks much for your time and have a great weekend

Best

MInho Choi
